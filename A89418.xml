            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Letter is come to my hands, which I take kindly from you: I ſhould deſire to exchange lines oftner with you; I thank you for your newes. I had Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters this day from my Lord <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall</hi> for the <hi>Maria</hi> Pinace to ride before this Town. We are yet in ſafety (bleſſed be God) but daily braved by the enemy, yet hitherto they have not dared to faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Town: And I have obſerved, that they have never come before this place, or neere it, but we have ſtill worſted them, wee have alwayes taken priſoners, Horſes, Armes, wounded or ſlain ſome of them. On Thurſday laſt we took ſix men and horſe, whereof one was a Cornet. On Saturday we took two men, Horſes and Armes, ſhot a Captain, who lies languiſhing at <hi>Ramſey,</hi> and wounded three men more. The Lord be ſtill our defence and refuge, and give us thankfull hearts for his preſervation over us. This poor County

of <hi>Hampſhire</hi> having had its ſhare of blood and miſery in this ſad tragedie of our Nation, that there is hardly left any thing for man or beaſt therein.</p>
            <p>I perceive you have received knowledge of a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous practize for the delivery of this Town, but leaſt you ſhould be miſ-informed therein, I will give you a briefe account thereof. Some few daies before Chriſtide laſt, the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> marched with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> towards <hi>Southampton,</hi> with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to face it, (as wee were informed,) but he came not within two Miles thereof, to out face it, but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to <hi>Redbridge,</hi> (the way into the new forreſt) breake it down to hinder us of proviſion from thence after ſo horible an Act, he faced about and marched to his old quarters againe, without attempting any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther atchievement.</p>
            <p>The next day here arived a letter from one Mr. <hi>Iaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Cornelius</hi> ſom times an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112919:3"/>
ſo fit to be wrought upon; but he was deceived, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never better pleaſed then to bee eaſed of ſo great a burthen, which I had born long enough, (though it pleaſed his Excellencie to requite my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with a more ſutable command to my diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made me Serjeant Major to Colonell <hi>Norton,</hi> which pleaſes me farre better) after the receit of this letter, I inſtantly acquainted my Colonell and Maſter Major therewith, we all agreed I ſhould ſhew a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complying the better to bottome their deſigne, and to find out what malignant party they had made in this town. I forthwith gave him a copie of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to explain his minde more fully. To which he replied, That by the command of his ſuperiours, hee did in the name of his Majeſty and his countrey, and two Lords (which hee named) offer mee a thouſand pounds in money, a preſent imployment of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and honour then at preſent I had, his Majeſties pardon under the great Seal, and his favour, if I would be a means to reduce the town of <hi>Hampton</hi> to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; I returned a ſeeming complying anſwer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the 1000 <abbr>l.</abbr> in hand, or the moity thereof, and aſſurance given me for the reſidue, the imployment named, and the pardon ſent me; this performed, hee ſhould ſoon ſee what I would ſay to it. In the interim my Colonell acquainted my L. Generall and Sir <hi>Will. Waller,</hi> with the offer made by <hi>Cornelius;</hi> wherein I continued the treaty to gain time, until Sir <hi>W. Waller</hi> had finiſhed his buſineſſe at <hi>Arundel,</hi> and drawn his Army this way, and then to have drawne the enemy hither in hope of gaining this place, whilſt Sir <hi>William</hi> might have falen behind them in this place of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and ſo to have deceived ſuch treacherous corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:112919:4"/>I continued the Treaty untill I had his Majeſties Signe Manuall for a pardon ſent me, and afterwards the pardon it ſelfe; but I could get no money, but ſtrong engagements of honour to performe with mee when the work deſired was effected. I whiled out a moneths time with them to the exchange of eight let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Mr. <hi>Robert Maſon</hi> being ſtill the man they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to bring their and receive my letters, whom they had bound to ſecreſie by an oath, before I knew thereof, who brought me the copie thereof, hoping to have gained me to the like, ſaying he had no engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all this time on me, neither by proteſtation nor promiſe, to perform with them; and which I ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed (which put the projectors to a jealouſie that I was not reall to them) yet to draw them ſtill on, I framed ſome offers, in the nature of Articles, for my ſelfe and this Towne (to which the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that upon his honour hee would performe them:) but I ſtill preſſed for the money, but could not obtain it, they fearing I would <hi>Craford</hi> them as <hi>Poole</hi> did; yet Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> offered me to become bound for it, which I accepted of: but before hee would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, on Friday laſt was ſennight he earneſtly preſſed me to declare my reality in the deſigne. I ſaw the man in a diſtracted extaſie, by his over zealouſneſſe and raſhneſſe for them, having no aſſurance of mee, my bowels pittied him, his wife and many children, told him plainly I never intended to be a villaine and traytor, to betray a truſt committed to mee, and the lives and goods of ſo many innocent people to bee made a prey to cruelty, and told him I have revealed it from the beginning to my Colonell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:112919:4"/>Then he begged I would conceale his name; I tould him I could not, but in campaſſion of his condition gave him leave to goe to his houſe (being but three houſes from mine,) in which time I went forthwith to acquaint my Colonell with what had happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> and my ſelfe, wee concluded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to ſieze his perſon, and cauſcd all the gates to be ſecured; but yet he eſcaped from us and could not be found, although wee ſearched carefully for him, ſince wee heer he is at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and ſhall be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and imployed in matter of truſt. In all the time of our treatie, I could not diſcover that he had any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates of any Townſmen with him, but had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it, to carry it alone. But I was greived that I was conceived by the adverſe part, to be a fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them. But now they have tryed me, I am confident, they will neuer doe the like, but to revenge themſelves on me: But I will to all the world declare and maintaine my faithfullneſſe to my Country and cauſe I have undertaken, and clear my unfained repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought good to ſay unto you, that you may give a ſatiſfactory teſtimony of that deſigne in my behalfe, if you heer it falſly reported. And I ſhall be readie to requite you in vindicating of truth, and acknowledge my ſelfe.</p>
